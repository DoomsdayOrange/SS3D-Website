Since the [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SS13/comments/9iggy5/i_have_acquired_almost_98_of_the_ss3d_assets_and/) on SS3D the coding from scratch has begun and so far there's animation for v1 of character movement as well as a few objects (cryo tube, lockers etc), an imported initial map and an inventory UI.

*Open-source?*

Yes, this project is open-source.

*Curse?*

All team members have access to the GitHub repo with the source code, so in the unlikely event that development stalls there are over half a dozen members who will be able to post the source for others to continue.

*What happened to \*beep?*

[Nobody knows](https://www.reddit.com/r/SS13/comments/97qtbs/ss3d_is_dead/), the original SS3D creator just disappeared so this project is continuing in a similar vein from scratch (though most of the assets have been recovered, just not the code).
