### Step by step guide:

1. Go to the appropriate board/list for your field and look for available tasks.
2. Pick a task, and request a @Centcom member on discord to assign you to that task.
3. Work on that task, using the correct style and formatting.
4. Request in-progress screenshots or videos to be posted in #wip for extra praise.
5. Submit the task (as a PR for code, or by posting the asset to discord and notifying someone in @Centcom).
6. They will review it, and may request changes.
7. Submit screenshots and/or videos to the #devblog channel along with a link for an asset or a summary for code.
8. Once accepted, pat yourself on the back for your glorious contribution to SS3D.

# How to contribute:

If you're a programmer, 2D artist, 3D modeler, musician, programmer, animator, soundcloud rapper, or *especially* a programmer, we need you! The game itself is being developed in the Unity game engine and can be download [here](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D) including instructions for setting up the project and what version of Unity we use.

**To start on any of these, read the appropriate guide(s), check out the appropriate board, and contact a council member on our discord.**

For any other questions, concerns, or unsolicited advice, just ask around on the discord and someone will likely help you out.

### Coding tasks:

Start by familarizing yourself with [our code style guide](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/blob/master/StyleGuides/C_SHARP.md), then visit our [code board](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/projects/2) for a task (the ones in the available column are ones you can start on), and information on pull requests or reporting bugs can be found [here](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### 3D modeling tasks:

Start by downloading our [Modeler’s Kit v1.4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/misc/SS3D Modeler's Kit 1.4.zip), and make sure to read [SS3D Style Guide.pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/SS3D Style Guide.pdf) and [SS3D Model Format Guide.pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/SS3D Model Format Guide.pdf) also contained within. Then visit our [models board](https://trello.com/b/ZVcDitv0/ss3d-model-list) to find a task to work on, and you can assign it to yourself via a custom bot in our discord (the channel #art-readme has more info on this). We recommend using [Blender v2.8](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/2-81/) or newer as it's free and open-soure like the game we are making and thus is easily accessible by most people and as a result our modeler's kit is mostly designed for use with Blender.

### Animation tasks:

Start by deciding on a task from our [animations board](https://trello.com/b/xZ5bhNWw/ss3d-animations). If it's related to the character rig, we have a [Character Animation Kit v1.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/misc/Character Animation Kit 1.0.zip) but it's currently only set up for Maya users, although you can use Blender to animate too.

### 2D art tasks:

We currently do not have any guides for 2D art, but you can visit our [2D board](https://trello.com/b/XVZ95Hjq/ss3d-2d) to find a task to work on.

### Sound tasks:

We currently do not have any guides for sfx, but if you want to scream like psychopath or fart into a microphone, check out our [sounds board](https://trello.com/b/k6pWgJE0/ss3d-sound-design).
