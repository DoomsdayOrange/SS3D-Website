This page is dedicated as a reference for RE:SS3D contributors.

**Step by step guide at the top in case someone asks and you don't want to write a wall of text:**

1. Go to the appropriate board/list for your field and look for available tasks.
2. Pick a task, and request a @Centcom member to assign you to that task.
3. Work on that task, using the correct style and formatting.
4. Post in-progress screenshots or videos to #wip for extra praise.
5. Submit the task (as a PR for code, or by posting the asset to discord and notifying someone in @Centcom).
6. They will review it, and may request changes.
7. Submit screenshots and/or videos to the #devblog channel along with a link for an asset or a summary for code.
8. Once accepted, pat yourself on the back for your glorious contribution to SS3D.

### How to contribute

If you're a programmer, 2D artist, 3D modeler, musician, programmer, animator, soundcloud rapper, or *especially* a programmer, we need you!
For coding tasks we have a [task board](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/projects/2) (the ones in the available column are ones you can start on). For more info on pull requests or reporting bugs check out the [contributing](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) page on our github.
and a [model list](https://trello.com/b/ZVcDitv0/ss3d-model-list).
To start on either just go to our discord and request an admin or moderator to assign you to a task you can see on there.
**But before you do please check the style guide below**.

For any other kind of task, e.g. sounds, concept art, or emotional support (please help me) just ask around on the discord and someone can help you out.

### Style guide & Kits

**The code style guide** can be found on our [here](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/blob/master/StyleGuides/C_SHARP.md). It contains:

**The model style guide** is contained in our [Modeler’s Kit v1.4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/misc/SS3D Modeler's Kit 1.4.zip) which contains several files to aid you in making 3D models for SS3D.
It contains:

- A modeling template file for Blender 2.8, complete with materials and a character model
- Our color palette (Palette05)
- Templates for making poster or blanket textures
- Our 'Spessman' font
- Beep's style and formatting guides
- Guides and example plants for hydroponics
