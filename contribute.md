### Step by step guide:

1. Go to the appropriate board/list for your field and look for available tasks.
2. Pick a task, and request a @Centcom member on discord to assign you to that task.
3. Work on that task, using the correct style and formatting.
4. Request in-progress screenshots or videos to be posted in #wip for extra praise.
5. Submit the task (as a PR for code, or by posting the asset to discord and notifying someone in @Centcom).
6. They will review it, and may request changes.
7. Submit screenshots and/or videos to the #devblog channel along with a link for an asset or a summary for code.
8. Once accepted, pat yourself on the back for your glorious contribution to SS3D.

## How to contribute:

If you're a programmer, 2D artist, 3D modeler, musician, programmer, animator, soundcloud rapper, or *especially* a programmer, we need you! The game itself is being developed in the Unity game engine and can be download [here](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D) including instructions for setting up the project and what version of Unity we use.

For coding tasks, we have a [task board](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/projects/2) (the ones in the available column are ones you can start on). Information on pull requests or reporting bugs can be found [here](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

For modelers, they can choose a model from our [model board](https://trello.com/b/ZVcDitv0/ss3d-model-list), as well as assign the model to themselves using a custom bot in our discord. We recommend using [Blender v2.8](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/2-81/) or newer.

To start on either just go to our discord, check out the appropriate board, and contact a council member.
**But before you do please check the style guides below**.

For any other kind of tasks, e.g. sfx, concept art, animations, farting into microphones, or babysitting, just ask around on the discord and someone can help you out.

## Style guides & kits:

**The code style guide** can be found [here](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/blob/master/StyleGuides/C_SHARP.md).

**The model style guide** is contained in our [Modeler’s Kit v1.4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/misc/SS3D Modeler's Kit 1.4.zip) which contains several files to aid you in making 3D models for SS3D, including:

- A modeling template file for Blender 2.8, complete with materials and a character model
- Our color palette (Palette05)
- Templates for making poster or blanket textures
- Our 'Spessman' font
- Beep's style and formatting guides
- Guides and example plants for hydroponics
