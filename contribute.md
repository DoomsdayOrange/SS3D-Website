This page is dedicated as a reference for RE:SS3D contributors.

**Step by step guide at the top in case someone asks and you don't want to write a wall of text:**

1. Go to the appropriate board/list for your field and look for available tasks
2. Pick a task, and request a @Centcom member to assign you to that task
3. Work on that task, using the correct style and formatting
4. Post in-progress screenshots or videos to #wip for extra praise
5. Submit the task (as a PR for code, or by posting the asset to discord and notifying someone in @Centcom)
6. They will review it, and may request changes
7. Submit screenshots and/or videos to the #devblog channel along with a link for an asset or a summary for code
8. Once accepted, pat yourself on the back for your glorious contribution to SS3D

### How to contribute

If you're a programmer, an artist, a soundcloud rapper, a programmer, none of the above, or *especially* a programmer, we need you!
For coding and modelling tasks we have a [task board](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/projects/2) (the ones in the available column are ones you can start on) and a [model list](https://trello.com/b/z0H4ci3u/ss3d-model-list-mkiv).
To start on either just go to our discord and request an admin or moderator to assign you to a task you can see on there.
**But before you do please check the style guide below**.

For any other kind of task, e.g. sounds, concept art, or emotional support (please help me) just ask around on the discord and someone
can help you out.

### Style guide & Kits
