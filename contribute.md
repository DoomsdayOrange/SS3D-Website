### Step by step guide:

1. Go to the appropriate board/list for your field and look for available tasks.
2. Pick a task, and request a @Centcom member on discord to assign you to it.
3. Work on that task, using the correct style and formatting.
4. Request WIP screenshots/videos of your contribution to be posted in the #wip channel for extra praise.
5. Submit the task (as a PR for code, or by posting the asset to discord and notifying a @centcom member).
6. Include a photo/video of your submission for the devblog, and if it's code, include a summary.
7. Centcom and maybe even the community will review it, and may request changes.
8. Once accepted, pat yourself on the back for your glorious contribution to SS3D!

# How to contribute:

If you're a programmer, 2D artist, 3D modeler, musician, programmer, animator, soundcloud rapper, or *especially* a programmer, we need you!

**To start on any of these, read the appropriate sections below which contains links to guides and task boards for those contribution types. Once you have a task in mind, contact a council member on our [discord]({{ site.discord_url }}){:target="_blank"}.**

The game itself is being developed in the Unity game engine. You can find what version of Unity we use and instructions on setting up our project on our [github contributing guide]({{ site.github_url }}/SS3D/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md){:target="_blank"}.

Our [github organization]({{ site.github_url }}){:target="_blank"} has 3 repositories.
- [SS3D]({{ site.github_url }}/SS3D){:target="_blank"} - the game itself, and some documents.
- [Website]({{ site.github_url }}/Website){:target="_blank"} - our (this) website.
- [CentCom]({{ site.github_url }}/CentCom){:target="_blank"} - central communications server, which manages user registration, authentication, and character storage, similar to what Byond is to SS13.

For any other questions, concerns, or unsolicited advice, just ask around on the discord and someone will likely help you out.

## Coding tasks:

Start by familiarizing yourself with our [code (C#) style guide]({{ site.github_url }}/SS3D/blob/master/StyleGuides/C_SHARP.md){:target="_blank"}, and [github contributing guide]({{ site.github_url }}/SS3D/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md){:target="_blank"}.

Feel free to help on any of our three repos as they could all use your help, but since most of you are here to help with the game itself, visit our SS3D [code board]({{ site.github_url }}/SS3D/projects/2){:target="_blank"} for a task (the ones in the available column are ones you can start on).

## 3D modeling tasks:

Start by downloading our [Modelerâ€™s Kit v1.4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/misc/SS3D Modeler's Kit 1.4.zip){:target="_blank"}, and make sure to read [SS3D Style Guide.pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/SS3D Style Guide.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [SS3D Model Format Guide.pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/SS3D Model Format Guide.pdf){:target="_blank"} contained within.

Then visit our [models board](https://trello.com/b/ZVcDitv0/ss3d-model-list){:target="_blank"} to find a task to work on, and you can assign it to yourself via a custom bot in our discord (the channel #art-readme has more info on this).

We recommend using [Blender v2.8](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/){:target="_blank"} or newer as it's free and open-source like the game we are making and thus is easily accessible by most people and as a result our modeler's kit is mostly designed for use with Blender.

## Animation tasks:

Start by deciding on a task from our [animations board](https://trello.com/b/xZ5bhNWw/ss3d-animations){:target="_blank"}. If it's related to the character rig, we have a [Character Animation Kit v1.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/misc/Character Animation Kit 1.0.zip){:target="_blank"} but it's currently only set up for Maya users, although you can use Blender to animate too.

## 2D art tasks:

We currently do not have any guides for 2D art, but you can visit our [2D board](https://trello.com/b/XVZ95Hjq/ss3d-2d){:target="_blank"} to find a task to work on.

## Sound tasks:

We currently do not have any guides for SFX, but if you want to scream like a psychopath or fart into a microphone, check out our [sounds board](https://trello.com/b/k6pWgJE0/ss3d-sound-design){:target="_blank"}.

## Submissions:

Technical contributions are submitted to [our main (SS3D) repo via pull request]({{ site.github_url }}/SS3D/pulls){:target="_blank"}.

Art contributions currently are submitted via the art channels on our [discord]({{ site.discord_url }}){:target="_blank"}.
