## What is RE:SS3D?

RE:SS3D is a resurrection of *beep's SS3D (a 3D recreation of Space Station 13 using the Unity game engine). If you go digging for SS3D, you might find bits and pieces, but you will ultimately find a trail that ends in silence. Here's the short story:

*These videos are reuploads of *beep's SS3D and are NOT representitive of RE:SS3D or it's progress!*

One day in early 2018, an individual by the name of *beep decided to create a game called SS3D, based upon a small prior made "demo" (video embedded above) that had been well-received. *beep was brilliant, and for those few beautiful, wonderful months of early 2018, *beep made leaps of progress faster than any remake before, and for some short time, the dream of SS3D was certain and inevitable. But when the world needed him most, he vanished...

No trace, no word, no *beep. The only thing left behind were a couple of files, a .blend, and a .pdf. Though *beep had intended to release the game open source, all of the development to that point had still been private and vanished along with him.

Many were appalled by this tragedy, some were content to continue waiting for *beep's return, a few handfuls chased after the ghost of *beep, searching every trail for any clue of what happened or where *beep went, but always found nothing.

Eventually, several months later, a message came from the hands of one who was once beneath *beep: "it's dead," and "I'm sorry." Suddenly and with little to no notice, almost every memory of communications regarding the project was neatly tidied up and packaged for prosperity, and all the rest was deleted or left to deliberate anarchy.

In the ashes immediately following the abandonment of the project to the horribly transient nature of anarchy, a suggestion was formed that some should take up the mantle and continue the project. A modest amount of support was garnered, and very quickly a **very** crude team was thrown together. The new project was named "RE:SS3D".

Over the first year of the new project, it has grown with many new helpful faces. But oftentimes life imposes itself on these voluntary contributors, sadly resulting in multiple arrivals and departures. Some people even relate this back to *beep and wonder if he simply got caught up with other aspects of his life and simply couldn't continue. Thankfully, the open-source nature of the new project allows others to easily pick up where previous individuals left off, limiting the negative impact of each departure.

We deeply thank those who have contributed in the past in any form and hope that they will come back in the future even to just play the game that they helped create.
