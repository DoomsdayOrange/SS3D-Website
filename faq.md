## Is there a playable demo?

Latest build can be found [here](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/releases/latest). 
But don't expect much yet, as we still have a lot of work to do.

## How much will the game cost?

It's free and open source.

## When will the game be completed?

The game likely won't be to the playable state SS13 has for a few years.

## What engine does it use?

The game is made with Unity, with Mirror for networking. 
For legal reasons we don't use assets from the Unity Asset Store, but open source assets are fine.

## Will there be "X" feature?

Since the project is open source, if it's not already added someone else, you'll be free to add it yourself.
We do however aim to have the lowest common denominator in terms of features carried over from SS13.
The most significant changes to the formula will be redesigns of the shortcomings and limitations of SS13 and its engine.
