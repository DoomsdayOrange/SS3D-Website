## FAQ

### How much will the game cost?

It's free.

### How do I know you're not gonna run off with the money?

It's free.

### What engine is this?

Unity.

### Will there be "X" feature?

It will be open source. You'll be free to add it yourself.

### Curse?

Don't talk about that. If it becomes an issue, we've got this whole place rigged to explode and our work to be released to the public.

### Why isn't it released to the public already?

Technically, it kind-of is. Right now, in this stage of development, though, the game is being developed by our team in a space sweatshop, and you can only get in by [applying](https://goo.gl/forms/DBaqHkIHk3z40KBE3). Once it's on its own two feet and can stand on its own, it'll be released in open source, as to the spirit of the game and as to *beep's wishes.

### Who's *beep?

*beep is the SS3D in RE:SS3D.
