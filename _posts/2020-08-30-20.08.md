Since when was a Nanotransen employee able to afford a house?

# August Recap

I promise you that we are still alive. Probably.

## UI Rework

*John* and *Alainx277* reworked the UI to be much prettier than before and added
a new intent cycler as well as the targeting doll. Most of the icons, save for
the hands, intent, and clothing, are still nonfunctional at the moment. This
will soon change.

## New Icons

*Konstatin* made some snazzy icons for player status and intent. Check em’ out.

## Fixes

**Ryan**

- Fixed the examine function by separating the description and title, allowing for more customization (like using bold words, etc) in the object descriptions.

- Fixed an issue where non-hosting clients were unable to examine networked objects.

- Fixed a bug where the interaction name was unreadable in the interaction wheel if the wheel is too close to the bottom (the text was below the wheel before, but Ryan allowed it to move to the top if the interaction wheel is too low on the screen).

## Updates

It ain’t a secret that the server has been a little on the quiet side lately, so to remedy this we are going to start hosting events. At the moment we will only be doing movie nights, as well as Jackbox nights. So, if you are up for watching a cool spacey movie or having fun with the developers and other members of the community in a game of *Push the Button*, check out [our google calendar](shorturl.at/acgu6) for the next upcoming event.

## Conclusion

While the previous month may have been excruciatingly slow, we are not going
anywhere. Here is to a more active September.
