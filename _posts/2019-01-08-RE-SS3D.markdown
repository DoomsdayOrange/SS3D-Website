Since the [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SS13/comments/9iggy5/i_have_acquired_almost_98_of_the_ss3d_assets_and/) on SS3D the coding from scratch has begun and so far there's animation for v1 of character movement as well as a few objects (cryo tube, lockers etc), an imported initial map and an inventory UI.

~~[Here's a gif album](https://imgur.com/a/XWKZI0G) with the current look/features.~~

~~Next features planned: gunplay, basic atmos and fleshing out the inventory system.~~

**FAQ**

*Open-source?*

Yes, this project is going to be open-source. It is currently not in order to avoid spaghetti code for the base game to make it easier on the modders and all the unique servers expected to arise. Plans are to release the code once something more substantial has been developed, which will be once the Milestone 3 update video has been released.

*Curse?*

All team members have access to the GitHub repo with the source code, so in the unlikely event that development stalls there are over half a dozen members who will be able to post the source for others to continue. 

*What happened to \*beep?*

[Nobody knows](https://www.reddit.com/r/SS13/comments/97qtbs/ss3d_is_dead/), the original SS3D creator just disappeared so this project is continuing in a similar vein from scratch (though most of the assets have been recovered, just not the code).
