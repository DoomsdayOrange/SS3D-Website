The community we share brings us joy and robustness for years to come.

# November Recap

Indeed we are still moving slow, but we havent left. We have been entertaining some ideas on how to increase productivity again, so we will see what comes of that hopefully soon. Again, if you want to help, you are more than welcome to do so in whatever means you are willing, though we especially need people who can work with Unity.

## Fixes

**John** made several changes to our in-game 3D assets, mostly fixing some topology issues.

## Models

**John** seems to also be the only one who made any models this month. He a (back row, moving left to right) portable teleporter, pin pointer, syndicate camera bug, flash, atmospheric analyzer, (front row) mining analyzer, hydroponics analyzer, medical analyzer, slime analyzer, & finally a new styled multitool.
