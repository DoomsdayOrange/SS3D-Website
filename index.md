RE:SS3D is a resurrection of the SS3D project (a 3D remake of SS13), and is being developed in the Unity game engine.
Our project boards can be found on our [github](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/projects) and [trello](https://trello.com/ress3d), while information regarding contributing can be found on our [contribute]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute/) page.

You can [download the current project](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/archive/master.zip) and build it yourself, or **[download our latest build](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/releases/latest)**, but don't expect much right now.
